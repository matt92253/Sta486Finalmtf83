# Libraries and data

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, include=F}

# Additional cleaning

```{r}
# data becomes more normal when we drop test scores that are zero
# also working with actual tests not pre, practice, honors code or learning aids

# Before and after effects of Covid-19 on module test scores

## Graph

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}


# create precovid data frame, fall of 2019
f19 <- mat125data %>% filter( year == 19 & season == "fall")
f19$covid <- "fall 2019, before covid"

# create post  covid data frame, fall of 2021
f21 <- mat125data %>% filter( year == 21 & season == "fall")
f21$covid <- "fall 2021, after covid"

# bind the two data frames together for visualization
pre_post <- rbind( f19, f21)

# order the factors
pre_post <- pre_post %>% 
  mutate( covid = fct_relevel( covid,
                               "fall 2019, before covid",
                               "fall 2021, after covid"))
